# Oregon State Univesity CS 362 Final Project
### Emily Dom√≠nguez, Amanda Crawford, Rebecca Croysdale

For this final project, we have to complete a report covering what we have learned this term.
The code portion of the project requires that we implement at least one issue per person.
We will be using a Battleship game (from CS 361) because the project we chose initially proved
to have few enough bugs that there weren't enough real issues for us to tackle.
